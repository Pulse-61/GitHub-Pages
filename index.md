  - created this page using the default GitPage Template
  - by using a '-' ahead of this text in index.md it displays an acutual Bullet on the page, #winning
  - not bad for 11hours into the creation of my first GitHub Blog, its kinda exciting learning new skillz, yeah I meant to spell that with a 'z"!
  - before I forget I would like to express my deepest Gratitude to the Staff, Contributors, Members, Learners, Students
  - by using the "#' formatter ahead of 'Goals' below then the number list is now diplayed on seperate lines vs cancatenated after 'Goals'
   
  # Goals
    1). Continue to explore and learn GitHub and its features/functions
    2). In the exploration phase of choosing which Coding language to learn leaning towards Python since I am concurrently learning Linux
    3). Familiarization with GitPages and the Jekyll Framework behind these pages..
